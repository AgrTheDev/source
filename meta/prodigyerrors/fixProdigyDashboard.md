## I can't log into the cheat dashboard?

If your prodigy account doesn't have a parent e-mail, the dashboard can't log in, because it won't be able to make a login token.

1. Go to Prodigy ([play.prodigygame.com](https://play.prodigygame.com/))
2. Log in with your credentials.
3. Click [Playing `at home`]
4. Prodigy will ask you to confirm an email address.
5. Go to [10minutemail.com](https://10minutemail.com/) and copy the email address (Don't close this tab, you'll need it later)
6. Paste the email into Prodigy and click `Next`.
7. Back on your 10minutemail tab, it should show that you have 1 email in your inbox.
8. Scroll down, you'll see an email called `[Prodigy] yourUsername needs your consent.`
9. Click that email, scroll down a bit, and click `I give my consent`.
10. Feel free to close your 10minutemail and Prodigy tabs, those aren't needed anymore.
11. Go to [prodigy-dashboard.hostedposted.com](https://prodigy-dashboard.hostedposted.com/)
12. Log in with your prodigy credentials. If this worked, then horray!
13. If this didn't work, you can ask for help in the [PMGH discord server](https://discord.gg/S7qCXRnNre).
