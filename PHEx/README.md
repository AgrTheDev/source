# Prodigy Hacking Extension (PHEx)

Combined with [P-NP](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/P-NP) to inject modified game files into Prodigy.

Made of the Redirector extension, no-csp, and a little extra spice ;)

## [Usage](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/meta/wiki/QUICKSTART.md)

## Building

Remember to run `npm i` first in the PHEx directory to download the required packages needed for the build command. You only need to do this once.

```cmd
npm run build
```
